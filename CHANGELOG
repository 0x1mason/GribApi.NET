CHANGELOG

0.6.0
====
* Added support for PNG compression.
* Added support for extracting subdomains ("boxes") from Gaussian grids.
* Added support for "GRIB_API_DIR_ROOT" environment variable to improve path definition of the Grib.Api root directory.
* Improved Grib.Api path checking and related error messaging.
* Improved IDisposable implementations to ensure memory is properly disposed.
* Changed access to the "values" field to an "out" function; this prevents users from iterate the "Values" property, which causes severe performance issues.
* Added type-checking for accessing/mutating keys via AsString, AsInt, etc.
* Expanded documentation.
* Multiple build script improvements.
* Fixed bad linking for libjasper in x64 builds

0.5.0
====
